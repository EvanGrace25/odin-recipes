Creating a recipe page, following the Odin Project

The goal here is to use the skills learned so far in the Odin Project Foundations course. 

Here are the following modules I have already gone through, and need to practice here:
Using Git
Text
Lists
Links
Images

After this project, I should be able to create basic webpages. After this module, I will be moving on to learning about CSS.
